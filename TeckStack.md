| Layer                  | Your Choice                          | My Evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Frontend Framework** | **React 18+**                        | ✅ Perfect. React has the best **Telegram WebApp SDK** support and largest developer base. Future-proof with concurrent rendering, Server Components (if ever needed).                                                                                  |
| **UI Library**         | **Ant Design**                       | ✅ Strong choice for **admin-style dashboards** — advanced tables, filters, forms. If you add Tailwind for Telegram-side mini-app styling, you’ll cover both UIs nicely.                                                                                |
| **State Management**   | **Zustand**                          | ✅ Agree 100%. Much simpler than Redux. Good for your “survey → voter → response” data flow.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Offline DB**         | **IndexedDB + Dexie.js**             | 🟡 *Optional but powerful.* For internal agent Mini Apps that might go offline in rural areas, Dexie.js makes sense. Keep it lazy-loaded (not mandatory at MVP).                                                                                       |
| **Backend Framework**  | **Node.js + Fastify**                | ✅ Excellent evolution. Fastify beats Express for high concurrency. You’ll get unified TypeScript end-to-end if you move backend from Python→Node. It also simplifies tRPC (below).                                                                     |
| **Database**           | **Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server** | ✅ Same as we finalized earlier. Perfect for reliability, JSONB, backups, and ACID compliance.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Cache**              | **Azure Cache for Redis**            | ✅ Perfect for voter search, session tokens, and heavy read endpoints. Integrates natively with Azure Monitor.                                                                                                                                          |
| **API Architecture**   | **REST with tRPC**                   | 🟢 Brilliant hybrid choice. You keep REST endpoints for external access, but internal React ↔ Fastify communication can use **tRPC** for type-safe DX. (You’d lose this if you stayed with FastAPI; that’s one reason a Node backend may be worth it.) |
| **Authentication**     | **Telegram Login Widget**            | ✅ Native, secure, frictionless — the right choice. Combine it with JWT for backend session continuity.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **File Storage**       | **Azure Blob Storage + CDN**         | ✅ Ideal. Cheap, scalable, and compliant. Use for voter photos or agent uploads.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Message Queue**      | **Azure Service Bus**                | ✅ Excellent for background jobs (bulk imports, notifications, audit logs). Better than RabbitMQ in Azure context.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Monitoring**         | **Azure Application Insights**       | ✅ Native, low friction, full-stack tracing.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Testing**            | **Vitest + Playwright**              | ✅ Modern, fast, TypeScript-first. Works perfectly with tRPC and React 18.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Deployment**         | **Azure Container Apps**             | ✅ Smart call. Gives you serverless scaling and isolation per constituency without managing AKS. Excellent balance of control vs simplicity.                                                                                                            |
| **CI/CD**              | **Azure DevOps**                     | 🟢 Solid enterprise choice. If you prefer lighter workflows, GitHub Actions still integrates seamlessly — both fine in Azure.                                                                                                                          |
| **Cloud Provider**     | **Microsoft Azure**                  | ✅ Perfect alignment with your ecosystem and compliance needs.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
